## Installation
* Backup Your server just incase, if something would go wrong.
* Download the latest release
* Unpack all files in the root folder of the server
* Run Fougerite.Patcher.exe in in rust_server_Data\Managed directory. (Or you can use the prepatched dll files)

**WARNING:** If you using Magma you must extract all your files from "save" to main server folder (with rust_server.exe).  
Plugins must be placed in "Server_Folder\Fougerite\MagmaPlugin" - for example "Server\Fougerite\MagmaPlugin\SuperPlugin.js"  
Other Plugins and Modules will have their own folders here, too.  See Fougerite.cfg.
